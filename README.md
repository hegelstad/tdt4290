# tdt4290

Monorepo containing three packages:

- `core`
- `view`
- `test-view`

## Getting started

- Install dependencies and bootstrap packages with `yarn`
- Build all packages with `yarn build` (`yarn watch` will build `core` and `view` continuously)
- Fire up `test-view` with `yarn start` (make sure the environment variables `REACT_APP_ORG` and `REACT_APP_TOKEN` are set)
